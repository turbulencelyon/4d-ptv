Matching
=========

How does it work?
    The "STM" algorithm used in this module have been developed by Mickael Bourgoin and Sander Huisman, and are described
    in a dedicated paper :cite:`bourgoin2020`. The main advantages over other methods is that the output does not depend
    on the order of the input, and scales well with the number of cameras.

    Let's consider again only one particle. If we have *N* cameras and if the particle is detected by *n* cameras, we have now :math:`n` lines in space. To determine the exact position of the particle, we have to find the closest point to these *n* lines simultaneously. The simpler method for that would be to take a line and to compute its distance to all other lines. Then taking the closest ones one gets particle position. However, this method would be very computing demanding.

    That's why we follow another method. As a picture is divided into pixels, we divide 3D space into small cubes called **voxel**. Then, all lines are drawn in this space. For each voxel, the distance between lines which crosses this voxel is computed. If the lines are close enough, a particle is created there. The space division into voxels decreases a lot computations because we only need to compute distance between lines crossing the voxel, which represents a very small number of computations comparing to compute the distance to all other lines.

    Besides, very powerful algorithm have been developped to drawn lines on pictures for television application. So the numerical cost to draw lines in a voxel space is very low.

    General scheme of matching operation. Particles are localised at rays crossing points. Red particles are real particles, purple ones are *ghost particles* and yellow one is supressed as it is outside of the measurement volume. Purple crosses show detected particles.

This step has been written in ``Python`` and in ``C++``. The ``Python`` version
should be as fast as the ``C++`` one. If you track several thousands of
particles, you should take a look at the PSMN part where we show how to
parallelise computations.

Python way
----------

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This package requires Python 3.8. The code is accelerated with `Transonic
<https://transonic.readthedocs.io>`_ and `Pythran
<https://pythran.readthedocs.io>`_. Some functions are transpiled to C++ to be
very efficient.

You first need to compile the code with the command ``make``. Note that you
need a quite recent C++ compiler (more details `here
<https://fluidsim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#about-using-pythran-to-compile-functions>`_).

To install the code, you have to follow the instructions in the README.md in the folder Matching/STMPython of the repository.

Usage
~~~~~

The documentation of the script can be obtained with ``./stm_hdf5.py -h``, which
gives:

.. code-block::

    usage: stm_hdf5.py [-h] [-md1r MIN_DISTANCE_MATCHES_1RAY]
                path_file start_frame stop_frame cam_match max_distance nx ny nz
                max_matches_per_ray [bounding_box]

    Space Traversal Matching: compute matches from rays projecting them into voxels.

    Example:

    export PATH_INPUT_DATA="../../Documentation/TestData/Processed_DATA/MyExperiment/Parallel/Matching/Rays/rays_11-20.dat"
    ./stm.py $PATH_INPUT_DATA 1 2 2 0.2 400 400 250 2

    or (to specify the limits of the visualized region):

    ./stm_hdf5.py $PATH_INPUT_DATA 1 2 2 0.2 400 400 250 2 "[[-140, 140], [-150, 150], [5, 170]]"

    positional arguments:
    path_file             Path towards the file containing the ray data
    start_frame           Index of the first frame
    stop_frame            Index of the last frame + 1
    cam_match             Minimum number of rays crossing to get a match
    max_distance          Maximum distance allowed for a match
    nx                    Number of voxels in the x direction
    ny                    Number of voxels in the y direction
    nz                    Number of voxels in the z direction
    max_matches_per_ray   Maximum number of matches/ray
    bounding_box          Corresponds to the volume visualized [[minX, maxX], [minY, maxY], [minZ, maxZ]]

    optional arguments:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    -md1r MIN_DISTANCE_MATCHES_1RAY, --min-distance-matches-1ray MIN_DISTANCE_MATCHES_1RAY
                            Minimum distance for multiple matches per ray

To run matching on test Data, in a terminal

.. code-block:: bash

    python stm_hdf5.py "../../Documentation/TestData/Processed_DATA/MyExperiment/Parallel/Matching/Rays/rays_11-20.dat" 1 10 2 0.2 400 400 250 2

The script creates in the rays folder a file in .h5 which contains all matched points. Use the function h52matches.m store in the folder ReadFiles of the repository to read the matches obtained.
Warning: the matching error calculated by the code is not correct (in spring 2025)!!
(It is also possible to use stm.py that gives a .dat file. This kind of .dat file can be openned with the Matlab function `readmatches.m`.)

.. code-block:: matlab

    [matches,other,params] = readmatches("My4DPTVInstallationPath/Documentation/TestData/Processed_DATA/MyExperiment/matched_11-20cam2_1-9.dat")

- **matches** which is a nmatches x 5 matrix [FrameNumber, x, y, z, Error]
- **other** which is a nmatches x ? matrix [NumberofRaysUsedInMatch, cam0ID,ray0ID,cam1ID,rays1ID,...]
- **params** whose *params.nframes* gives number of frames and *params.nmatches* provides number of matches.

.. warning::

    Spatial unit:

        The distance unit is fixed during calibration step. Then all distances
        like maxdistance, bounding_box or particles positions are given in the
        same unit.

    Ghost particles:

        On the scheme, one can see orange particles. These particles does not
        correspond to real particles but they correspond to rays crossing
        points. These particles are called *ghost particles*. Setting the
        parameter *maxmatchesperray* to one can limit the number of these
        particles. However, if *maxmatchesperray* is equal to 1, then when two
        particles overlap, only one will be detected. That's why we prefere to
        set *maxmatchesperray* to 2. As ghost particles completely disappear
        between two successive frames, they will be suppressed by the tracking.

    Interest of bounding_box:

        On the scheme, there is two rays crosses outside of the measurement box
        (it is the yellow disk). As the bounding_box gives the space limits of
        measurement volume, this yellow particle is not consider as a match.


C++ way
--------

.. warning:: Compilation of C++ code

    If you followed the installation process, you have already compiled the C++ code. If not, just do in a terminal

    .. code-block:: bash

        cd 4D-ptv/Matching/STMCpp/
        make

The ``C++`` function is ``STM`` and it takes 18 arguments:

- **inputfile** (*-i*): Input file,
- **output dir** (*-o*): Output directory,
- **frames** (*-f*): number of frames,
- **mincameras** (*-c*): minimum number of rays for a match,
- **maxdistance** (*-d*): maximum distance allowed for a match,
- **multiplematchesperraymindistance** (-s*): minimum allowed distance between matches found for the same ray,
- **maxmatchesperray** (*-m*): maximum matches per ray,
- **nx ny nz** (*-x -y -z*): number of voxels in each direction,
- **boudingbox** (*-b*): bouding box minX maxX minY maxY minZ maxZ.

By defaut, it saves results in a h5 file.

.. warning:: How to access to ``STM`` documentation?
    Do in a terminal

    .. code-block:: bash

        ./STM -h

.. figure:: Figures/InOutputSTMcpp.png
    :width: 100%

    Input and output files of ``STM.cpp`` function.


with the same meaning than for Python way. The ``C++`` language requires to compile scripts before running them. That is done automatically during the library installation. The compiled version of ``STM.cpp`` is ``STM``.

How to compile ``STM.cpp`` file ?
    We did a ``makefile`` which simplifies everything for you. Before using the 4D-PTV toolbox for the first time, just do:

    .. code-block:: bash

        cd My4DPTVInstallationPath/4d-ptv/Matching/STMCpp/
        make

    That will compile all ``.cpp`` files you will need later.
    The command to compile a classic C++ code is:

    .. code-block:: bash

        g++ -std=c++11 -o STM.o STM.cpp

.. note::
    To run ``STM`` with test Data:

    .. code-block:: bash

        cd MyPath/4D-PTV/Matching/STMCpp/
        ./STM -i ../../Documentation/TestData/Processed_DATA/MyExperiment/Parallel/Matching/Rays/rays_11-20.dat -o ../../Documentation/TestData/Processed_DATA/MyExperiment/Parallel/Matching/Rays/ -f 10 -c 2 -d 0.2 -s 1 -m 2 -x 400 -y 400 -z 250 -b -140 140 -150 150 5 170 --hdf5
 
.. seealso::

    STM help:
        It is possible to show STM help doing:

        .. code-block:: bash

            ./STM -h

    Config file:
        The option ``--print-config`` of ``STM`` will create a config file containing all input parameters.

    How to install``g++``?
        It is installed by default on Linux. Otherwise:

        .. code-block:: bash

            sudo apt-get install -y build-essential
            sudo apt install gcc
